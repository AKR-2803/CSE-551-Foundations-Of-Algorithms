#### Approximation Algorithms

- ( | APP(I) - OPT(I) | ) / OPT(I) <= E for all instances.
- Error given by the algorithm. (We'd like to keep the error down)
- However, we cannot guarantee that the error will be `X` percentage. It might produce a solution with 0 error, but it can't be guaranteed. The error may be 5000%, in which case the algorithm is not such a great algo
- Aim: Is there a way where we can possibly guarantee that the error would not be more than `X` percentage?
- Consider the fact that the no. of instances are infinite, so when we claim or guarentee that the error rate is not greater than `X` percentage it is for ALL THESE INSTANCES. Even though we cannot run all the instances. So how can we exactly achieve this?
- Probably, we can give a bound on the error.
- OPT is solution with zero error. APP is the one with approximate error(`X` that we were talking about earlier.)
- But OPT would take say 300 centuries to get there, hence we focus on finding the APP. Say if we had OPT after running 300 centuries, we would not go behind the APP.
- But the fact that we do not have the OPT is the reason why we want to find the APP in the first place.
- Then how can we approximate say `[APP(I_tsp) / OPT(I_tsp) ] <= 1.2`, whtihout even knowing `OPT(I_tsp) = ?`.
- We can find `OPT(I_tsp) >= X` : Claim that no matter what the OPT would not be lesser than `X`. 
- Any tour int TSP must have `n` edges, hence `OPT(I_tsp) >= X`, where `X = e1 + e2 + ... + en` (e1, e2,...en being the edge weights) Because in any case, in Travelling Salesman Problem we need to travel `n` edges.
- Hence  `APP(I_tsp) <= Y`
- So, `[APP(I_tsp) / OPT(I_tsp) ] <= Y / X`
